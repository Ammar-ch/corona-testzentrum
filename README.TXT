# COVID-19 Test Appointment System

This Java console application simulates a simplified COVID-19 test booking system for customers in Germany. It allows customers to enter personal information, select a test type, choose a test station, and generate an appointment. The system also determines if the test is free based on age or specific conditions (e.g. pregnancy or foreign students).

* Accessors and `toString()`

### `Console`

Provides input/output and validation utilities:

* `read_data_kunde()`: reads customer data from console
* `controlEmail()`: validates email using regex
* `controlTestGratis()`: checks if test is free based on age or condition
* `alert()`: shows GUI alert using Swing
* `clearConsole()`: clears console output (not fully functional)

### `Termin`

Represents a test appointment:

* Holds references to a `Kunde`, `COVID19_Test`, and `Test_station`
* Randomly generates appointment date and time
* Calculates and prints test cost or confirms free eligibility

### `main`

Handles:

* Initializing test types and stations
* Reading user input and data
* Offering test selection and creating an appointment
